# Avoid Nested Code Blocks in Blog Posts

- **Do NOT use triple backticks (```) inside another triple backtick code block in any markdown/MDX blog post.**
- MDX does not support nested code fences and this will cause build errors.
- If you need to show code-within-code, use 4-space indentation for the inner code, or use a single code block and clearly comment or separate the sections.

See [README.md](mdc:README.md) for more details.
