## About Me

I'm a Principal Developer and Technical Lead with over 10 years of experience architecting and delivering enterprise-grade solutions. Currently leading technical initiatives at Datacom in Auckland, New Zealand, I specialize in modernizing legacy systems, implementing cloud-native architectures, and mentoring high-performing development teams.

My expertise spans the full technology stack - from .NET and C# backend development to React and Angular frontend applications, with deep knowledge of Azure cloud technologies and Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.

## What I Do

**Technical Leadership**: I architect scalable solutions, lead cross-functional teams, and drive technical strategy for critical business applications. My approach combines strategic thinking with hands-on development to deliver exceptional results.

**Cloud & Infrastructure**: Expert in Azure cloud technologies, implementing microservices architectures, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, and DevOps practices with CI/CD pipelines.

**Full-Stack Development**: Building modern applications using .NET Core, React, Angular, and TypeScript, with expertise in database design and optimization across SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB.

**Mobile & Cross-Platform**: Developing mobile applications using Flutter and implementing responsive web solutions that work seamlessly across all devices.

## My Impact

Throughout my career, I've successfully:
- **Modernized Legacy Systems**: Transformed monolithic applications into cloud-native, microservices architectures
- **Led Technical Teams**: Mentored developers and facilitated technical discussions with stakeholders  
- **Optimized Performance**: Improved application performance and reduced Azure costs through strategic architectural improvements
- **Implemented DevOps**: Established CI/CD pipelines, automated deployments, and Infrastructure as Code practices
- **Delivered Innovation**: Built award-winning solutions and contributed to platform development at Sitecore

## Personal Projects

I'm passionate about creating tools that solve real-world problems:

- **[Resume Pro](https://resumepro.iamjeevan.com)**: ATS-friendly resume generator with modern UI and real-time preview
- **[Vanish Notes](https://vanishnotes.iamjeevan.com)**: Secure, self-destructive note sharing with end-to-end encryption  
- **[NZ Salary Calculator](https://nzsalarycalculator.iamjeevan.com)**: Comprehensive tax and deduction calculator for New Zealand
- **[Flash Card Fest](https://flash-card-fest.netlify.app)**: AI-powered study tool using OpenAI for content generation

## Continuous Learning

I hold multiple certifications including AWS Solution Architect Associate, Azure Developer, and SAFe 4.0 Practitioner. I believe in staying current with emerging technologies and best practices, always exploring new ways to deliver better solutions.

When I'm not architecting solutions or mentoring teams, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects, writing about technology trends, or exploring the latest developments in cloud computing and AI.
